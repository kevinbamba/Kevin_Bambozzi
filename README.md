*<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>*

I am a Data Scientist with a focus on Data Analyst, using tools like Power BI Dashboards, Excel and strong Python and SQL skills.
As an independent analyst I have developed critical thinking. And by being a technician in charge of a branch, I acquired the ability to work in a team and the knowledge of how the business organization works. While studying Data Science at Henry I discovered my passion for Data Analyst, turning complex data into actionable insights, generating innovative ideas and delivering effective solutions to business challenges.
